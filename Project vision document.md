1. **Executive summary (max. 150 words)**
All over the world we have  heard about whatâ€™s happening in Ukraine currently. In our engineering project we present the Telegram bot with the main goal to highlight the ways to aid Ukrainian government, find or provide the accommodation for those who are in the need, and the references to trustworthy resources for further update on thew current news.

The problem detected is lack of software that would help Ukrainians that are migrating find any sort of help they can get and connect them with people that are willing to help all over the world using Telegram bot(for example find places to stay, connect them to people who are willing to host them, find places with humanitarian help provided etc.).    
Target group is people in Ukraine who are forced to migrate from Ukraine because of war and needs help and people from all over the world who are ready to help them by any chance and travelers who is searching for accommodation to stay for free(see 2, Disclaimer)  

Risks: Some of the functionalities will become outdated because of fast change of war situation in Ukraine.

Benefits: providing Ukrainian refugee with help of any kind and providing people from Poland with opportunity to help them, more than one language support, huge accommodation searching system
